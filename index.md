### Mary Had a Little Lamb
The above video demo is a short clip of using the allolib_playground library, using the 01_Sine_Env_Piano file to play Mary Had a Little Lamb. It was quite difficult for me as I am not very musically inclined at all. I learned how to play the melody using one voice as that was what was easiest for my skill set. Unfortunately, the recording is super choppy and I no longer have the synthSequence file as the computer I did that project on blew up...
