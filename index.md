## Project 1 - Simple Melody

### Mary Had a Little Lamb

The above video demo is a short clip of using the allolib_playground library, using the 01_Sine_Env_Piano file to play Mary Had a Little Lamb. It was quite difficult for me as I am not very musically inclined at all. I learned how to play the melody using one voice as that was what was easiest for my skill set. Unfortunately, the recording is super choppy and I no longer have the synthSequence file as the computer I did that project on blew up...

## Project 2 - Instrument Synthesis

### Flute Synthesis

The goal of this project was to explore instrument synthesis techniques. I started by simply looking at all of the instruments in the tutorial/synthesis folder of allolib_playground while doing some research on how each of those respective synthesis techniques works. I chose two synthesis techniques that I found sounded good. Before combining the two I had no plan to simulate a specific instrument. However, for the third project, I wanted a sound that would work well to give me a mix of "unsettling" and "calming" sounds and I thought the flute would be the best for that. Once I combined AM and Sine wave synthesis, I played around with the ADSR values of my new instrument till it produced those "unsettling" and "calming" sounds.<br/>

The first video linked is a simple demo of the instrument I created, playing each of its notes. The second video linked is a simple melody I created myself with my instrument. Those are some of the notes I liked and I will probably use them for project 3.
