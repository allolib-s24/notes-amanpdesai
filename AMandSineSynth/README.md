# Flute Synthesis
## AM and Sine Wave Synthesis

Using a combination of AM and Sine Wave synthesis to create the sounds of a flute.

[AM.cpp](https://github.com/allolib-s24/notes-amanpdesai/blob/main/AMandSineSynth/AM.cpp) is the instrument that runs AM and Sine wave synthesis.<br/>
The [bin](https://github.com/allolib-s24/notes-amanpdesai/tree/main/AMandSineSynth/bin) directory is mainly there so that it is easy to load the instrument data aka the presets and the recordings I made.<br/>
<br/>
To download and implement my instrument, simply download the AM.cpp file and put it into the allolib directory. To also include the presets and my recording, download the bin directory as well and put it in the same folder as the AM.cpp file.
